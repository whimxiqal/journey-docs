# Journey Integration Plugins

Servers can make full use of Journey by integrating it with other plugins. Plugin developers may use the [Journey API](/docs/category/developers) to make this possible by integrating their own plugins with Journey.

Below are some projects that integrate Journey with some popular plugins. If you are using any of the ones listed below, it is recommended that you also download and use the corresponding integration plugin.
