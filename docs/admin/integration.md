# Journey Integration Plugins

Servers can make full use of Journey by integrating it with other plugins. Plugin developers may use the [Journey API](/docs/category/developers) to make this possible by integrating their own plugins with Journey.

Below are some projects that integrate Journey with some popular plugins. If you are using any of the ones listed below with Journey on the same server, it is recommended that you also download and use the corresponding integration plugin to get the most out of both.

:::info
Since these plugins work with and depend on multiple other plugins, please verify that you have the right versions.
